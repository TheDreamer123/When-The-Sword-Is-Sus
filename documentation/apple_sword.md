    <summary>Golden Apple Sword</summary>
    The golden apple sword, when eaten behaves as it's vanilla counterpart, the only difference being the duration of the effects is shorter.
    If a zombie villager is hit with it, as long as it's under the weakness effect, it'll work like you right-clicked with a golden apple on it.
