# Glass Sword
The glass sword is fragile as hell, you can only use it once, and when used, you'll get a glass cut and get damaged.
If eaten, you get an effect that damages anything that hits you, when it's over, it kills you instantly, bypassing the totem of undying.

  It can be dyed just like leather armor, combining dye is also possible.
