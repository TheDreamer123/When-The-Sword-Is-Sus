# Slime Sword
The slime sword is like a normal sword but with a very powerful knockback.
It can be combined with magma cream and blaze powder to melt the slime.

When eaten all sounds get replaced by the slime's, your health bar turns green, you take damage (unless eaten molten) and allows you to bounce on every block.

  The molten variant doesn't damage the player when eaten.

  It stays molten for a minute and a half, although it can be reverted by either throwing it into water or by combining it with a water bucket on your crafting grid.
