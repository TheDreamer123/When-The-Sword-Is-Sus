    <summary>Bread Sword</summary>
    The bread sword is like any other, except it can be thrown into water to wet it.
    Wet bread swords are more fragile and when eaten instantly kill you, bypassing even the totem of undying, if you want to revert it, simply throw the item inside a sand block.

        <summary>Golden Apple Sword</summary>
        The golden apple sword, when eaten behaves as it's vanilla counterpart, the only difference being the duration of the effects is shorter.
        If a zombie villager is hit with it, as long as it's under the weakness effect, it'll work like you right-clicked with a golden apple on it.

        	<summary>Enchanted Golden Apple Sword</summary>
            The enchanted golden apple sword, just like the non-enchanted version, gives it's effects when eaten, the zombie villager mechanic no longer works but when sneaking and right-clicking, instead of eating it, you can throw a projectile that is affected by the sword's enchantments.

    <summary>Glass Sword</summary>
    The glass sword is fragile as hell, you can only use it once, and when used, you'll get a glass cut and get damaged.
    If eaten, you get an effect that damages anything that hits you, when it's over, it kills you instantly, bypassing the totem of undying.
