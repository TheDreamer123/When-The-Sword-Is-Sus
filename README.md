    <summary>Glass Sword</summary>
    The glass sword is fragile as hell, you can only use it once, and when used, you'll get a glass cut and get damaged.
    If eaten, you get an effect that damages anything that hits you, when it's over, it kills you instantly, bypassing the totem of undying.

        <summary>For those that didn't get this terrible pun:</summary>
        It can be dyed just like leather armor, combining dye is also possible.

    <summary>Anvil Sword</summary>
    The anvil sword, as it name says, is very heavy, so heavy it makes jumping harder and falling way faster, it also makes foes travel through the center of the Earth! (The higher you jumped from the more they get buried.)
    <br></br>
    If eaten, it makes you heavier.
